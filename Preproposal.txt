The University of Arizona Campus Arboretum is a living laboratory promoting stewardship and conservation of urban trees through research, education and outreach. The campus itself was used as a proving ground and living laboratory in sustainability, evaluating hundreds of new species and cultivars for their adaptation to this urban and arid region.
